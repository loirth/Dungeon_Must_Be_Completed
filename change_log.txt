Notes on v.0.0.1 (Jam Version):
	The game is playable!
	Only one level and some bugs
	
	I need to:
		- Fix bug when:
			block (honey, but maybe others too) fly away if you place in that block another block
		- Add sounds and music, but not from sfxr, they too bad
		- Make better tilemap (only one tileset and autotiling)
		- Add post processing
		- Add some levels
		- Add new mechanics:
			- Arrows
			- Buttons
			- Enemy ball
			- Enemy tiles (watch concept document)
