Game Name: Not determined


Description: A 2D platformer with dynamic decision-making to help a ball navigate levels.


Genre: 2D platformer + possibly side-scroller


Graphics: 2D pixel art with a focus on simple geometric shapes and post-processing.


Target Audience: Everyone


Features:
  - We play as a tile instead of a typical player character.
  - Slow-mo (Possibly won't be included).
  - Possibility of different level progression options based on level design.


Story:
  Considered:
    We are a tile in a dungeon that comes to life.
    In our contemplation of "why?" and "why am I here?", we notice a player character, a ball, entering the dungeon.
    We decide to help the ball navigate the dungeon and find answers to its questions.

  Cutscene:
    The tile starts trembling,
    Then emerges from the wall,
    Flips upwards,
    Opens its eyes,
    Question mark above it,
    Blinks,
    Cutscene ends with the screen fading out and smoothly transitioning to the menu while the music starts.

Mechanics:
  - Jumping
  - Long jump (slime ability)
  - Tile transformation (each type will have its own abilities for the player and other objects, like buttons)
  - Time slowdown (possibly)

  Under consideration:
    - Dash ?
    - Buttons (press by absorbing an arrow and releasing or shooting it at the button, or transform into a box for the ball to knock off)
    - Arrows (kill the ball, activate buttons, can be absorbed and used by the player when transformed into a slime)
    - Press (kills the ball, activated by a button, player must prevent the button from activating)
    - Laser ? (kills the ball, deactivated by a button, possibly temporary or permanent)

World:
  Simple room, possibly in side-scrolling format (long and continuous scrolling in one direction at a constant speed)

Characters:
  Ball:
    Appearance - metallic/stone ball.
    Rolls towards the finish line in one direction without AI, simply moving at a constant speed.
    Interacts with different tile types:
      - Slime: Bounces/changes direction along the x-axis if the slime was on the wall.
      - Honey: Slows down movement on the floor and descent on the wall, while the ball rolls on the ceiling without falling until it exits the honey.
      - Box: The ball can move the box, for example, to knock it onto a button.
      - Block: Stops upon collision with a wall and rolls on the floor.

  Player:
    Appearance - wall tile.
    Can:
    - Move sideways.
    - Jump.
    - Change tile type (only themselves).

    Tile Types:
    - Block (wall and floor):
      - Regular block.
    - Slime:
      - Absorbs arrows.
      - Can jump higher.
    - Honey:
      - Can crawl on the wall or ceiling.
      - Absorbs arrows (possibly, or only when transformed into slime).
    - Box (under consideration):
      - Activates a button upon falling.
      - Breaks when hit by an arrow or a press (if included).
      - When broken, the player either dies or the block type switches to a wall.

  Enemy (under consideration):
    - Appearance: Black/coal ball.
    - Has the same AI as the ball but rolls towards a different exit.
    - All tiles for the enemy are set at the start of the level.
    - The player needs to obstruct the enemy from reaching its exit, otherwise, the exit for our ball will be blocked.
